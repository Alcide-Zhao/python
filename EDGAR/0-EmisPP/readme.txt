Scripts under this folder were designed specifically to map the EDGAR aerosol emissions to the CESM formats
	Aerosols are being processed into number of molecules and particles based upon particle size assumption
	Regridding is performed through a sum-projection-average processed
	Species include CO,NH3,NOX are directly put into the model grids (196*288)
	
	
	- The 1970 folder is different as the emission file formats that EDGAR provides are different in both Units and file formats
    - The EDGAR emission scenarios are inter-compared to the RCP8.5 in the scenario_comparison
